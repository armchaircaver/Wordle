The algorithm examines each word W from the thousands allowed, calculating the viable solution word that would maximise the number of viable solutions still available if word W were entered next.

The word that minimises that maximum is the one recommended by the algorithm.

After the first word has been entered into Wordle, the algorithm typically takes 3 to 4 seconds on a laptop to choose a recommended word. The run time reduces significantly as more words are entered into Wordle.
